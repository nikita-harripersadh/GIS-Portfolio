# GIS Portfolio 
## Nikita Harripersadh 

Welcome to my GIS portfolio. I am a recent Environmental Science graduate with practical experience in QGIS and ArcGIS Pro. This portfolio demonstrates my ability to apply geospatial skills to real-world and academic projects, including cartography, spatial analysis, and geospatial coding.

## About Me
I’m a recent graduate from Rhodes University with a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and Human Kinetics and Ergonomics. I hold a certificate in ArcGIS Pro Basics from Esri South Africa and am passionate about continuous learning—regularly completing Esri Academy and LinkedIn Learning courses to expand my GIS skillset.

My journey into GIS began through my environmental science coursework, where I discovered the value of spatial data in understanding and addressing real-world challenges. This interest was further strengthened during a four-month GIS internship at Kartoza, where I gained hands-on experience using QGIS for spatial data processing, mapping, and analysis within a professional geospatial environment. 

GIS has since become the intersection of data, geography, and storytelling that now shapes my career goals.

## Why GIS?
I’m a student of Environmental Science and Human Kinetics & Ergonomics, with a deep interest in how people interact with their environments — both natural and built. My passion lies in using spatial data and mapping tools to understand and respond to environmental challenges like wildfire risk, climate change, and land use impacts.

## Whats Next?
**Availability:** Open to internships, collaborations, or junior GIS roles.


As I continue to develop my career in environmental science and geospatial analysis, I am motivated to apply my GIS skills to addressing real-world challenges through spatial data and technology. I am eager to strengthen my technical expertise across GIS platforms while contributing to projects that support climate resilience, sustainable land management, and informed decision-making for communities.

I am actively seeking internship or junior-level opportunities where I can learn from experienced geospatial professionals and contribute meaningfully to impactful mapping and analysis work within a collaborative environment.

- **Tools Used:** QGIS
- **Learning Outcomes:** 
Create and manage GeoPackages.
Import layers into GeoPackages.
Add new attribute data to layers.
Save QGIS projects within GeoPackages.
Style layers and manage map themes.
Annotate maps with graticules, north arrows, insets, and labels.
Used advanced QGIS labelling features like rule-based labels, manual placement, and callouts.
